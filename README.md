# 🎉 42-printf

## 📝 Overview
This project is a recoding of the famous \`printf\` function in C. It is designed to help you understand:
- 🛠️ What a **variadic function** is.
- 📜 How to work with variadic functions and access their elements via macros like \`va_list\`, \`va_start\`, and \`va_arg\`.

---

## 📚 Core Concepts
- 🔧 Variadic functions
- 🖋️ Handling format specifiers
- 🧵 Understanding low-level function implementation

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akarichan00/1337-printf.git
```

### 2️⃣ Enter the repository and compile the files using \`make\`:
```bash
cd 1337-printf
make
```

### 3️⃣ Use it in your code
To use the library functions in your code, clone it in your project's root folder and simply include its header:
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
